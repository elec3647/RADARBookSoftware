JupyterLab is flexible: configure and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. JupyterLab is extensible and modular: write plugins that add new components and integrate with existing ones."

You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters. Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing, for example:\n",

As of the 1.0 release (June 2019), it is additionally ready for extension writers who wish to further customize the JupyterLab experience for others. Please review the JupyterLab Changelog for detailed descriptions of each release.\n",
